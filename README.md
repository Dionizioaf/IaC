# IaC
The IaC for the creation of the environment.

We are going to save here the Terraform and Ansible code. We are going to implement modules and the deploy in the same repository.

We are going to implement the Ansible here too, but by Dec/2023 we dont know what we will use with Ansible.

## Folder doc

In this folder we have the information of the project.
